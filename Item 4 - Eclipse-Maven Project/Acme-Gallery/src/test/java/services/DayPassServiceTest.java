	// [UC-043] Visitor buy a day pass for an exhibition.
	// 
	// Related requirements:
	//    REQ 3: A museum sells several day passes. There are two kinds of day passes: general
	//			  and private day passes. General day passes give access to public areas of the
	//			  museum whereas private ones do also grant access to some private exhibitions.
	//			  For every day pass the system must keep track of: the price (which must be 
	//	  	      greater or equal than a symbolic quantity - that is, 1euro - ), purchase and visit
	//			  dates, the corresponding room in case it's a private exhibition and a ticker 
	//			 (following the pattern AAAA-uuuu-XXXX where "AAAA" is the unique identifier of
	//			  the museum, "uuuu" is the user name and "XXXX" are numbers).
	//
	//    REQ 9: Exhibitions can be either public or private. A day pass must be purchased in 
	//			  order to access private exhibitions whereas public ones can be visited by all
	//			  the visitors of a museum.
	//
	//    REQ 24.20: An actor who is authenticated as a visitor must be able to buy a day pass for
	//				  a private exhibition by entering a credit card. Day passes cannot be edited or
	//				  deleted

	//    REQ 24.22: An actor who is authenticated as a visitor must be able to list the day passes 
	//				  that she or he has bought
